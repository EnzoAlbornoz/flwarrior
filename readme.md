#### Formal Languages Class Project

This project has is divided between **back-end** and **front-end**.

The back-end is under the `lib/` folder and is used by the front-end to implement the logic of Grammars, RegularExpressions, and Machines. Each of these, in the front-end, have their own `index.tsx` and edit `pages.tsx`. The front-end is located in the `pages/` folder.

We also use the browser-integrated database to store information about the languages, which makes this project esclusively client-sided. This is located in the `database/` folder.
